# Sheepdog wiki

Sheepdog is a distributed storage system for QEMU. It provides highly available block level storage volumes that can be attached to QEMU-based virtual machines. Sheepdog scales to several hundreds nodes, and supports advanced volume management features such as snapshot, cloning, and thin provisioning.

Enjoy!

## Release Plan

The latest pulished version is the [v0.4.0](https://github.com/collie/sheepdog/tarball/v0.4.0), with:
  
   - a new store driver 'farm'
   - an object cache support 
   - sheepfs
   - a tracer support
   - support for variable virtual nodes
   - start sheep daemon as gateway
   - cluster driver cleanups
   - object list cache
   - zookeeper cluster driver
   - many bug fixes

See [[Changelog]] for more details.

 * 0.5.0 is probably due to the end of september 2012, with:
   - differential backup of VDIs
   - variable object size
   - variable virtual nodes according to the free spaces
   - server-side write cache (write object without O_DSYNC, and sync
     them when qemu sends a flush request.  I think we can use it
     combined with object cache.)
   - redesign threads for better performance
   - testing framework

 * 1.0.0 is expected for the end of the year
